# Time-Series-Project
This project is based on my final independent project conducted for my Msc. Computer Science with Cyber security degree at the University of york.

## Project Title: ARIMA and Prophet: A Comparison of Time-Series Analysis Models for Forecasting Cyber-Security Incidents.

- Data Collection: The study used secondary data from three reputable sources known for providing extensive cyber event data: the UK Data Service, Statista, and the DPHHS of the United States. These platforms contributed extensive datasets for the study, including government statistics, analytics, and a detailed breach database from the healthcare industry.
